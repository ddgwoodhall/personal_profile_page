        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring web developer who's interested in the possibities that learning web development may offer. I've lived in London, Istanbul and South Africa. I hope that by the end of a course with teamtreehouse.com in front-end web development I will have the skills to continue learning independently and become a highly skilled web developer.</p>
        <p>I've done many jobs from coffee barista to wholesale tyre dealing. I am happy to have come across teamtreehouse.com with its clear learning tracks in areas that can quickly become overwhelming when trying to navigate alone.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would like to progress from being a good front-end developer to eventually being able to do full-stack web development.

          <li>JQuery</li>
